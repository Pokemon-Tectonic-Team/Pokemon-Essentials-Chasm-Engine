# Pokemon Essentials Chasm Engine

This engine is based on Pokemon Essentials v19.1, but includes a significant amount of changes and feature additions, in particular reworks to how new moves, abilities, and effects are implemented and a much more extendable AI system.

When making your own game forked off this engine, be sure to replace all instances of "Your Game Name Here" with the name of your game, including in the RPG Maker settings.
